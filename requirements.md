#### Technical Infrastructure
- **Development Environment**: WordPress development setup with version control
- **Testing Environment**: Staging server for integration testing
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring Tools**: Performance and error monitoring

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### High Risk
🔴 **Microsoft Entra ID Integration Complexity**
- *Risk*: SSO integration delays due to university IT policies
- *Mitigation*: Start Entra ID setup early, have fallback authentication ready

🔴 **Data Migration from Current System**
- *Risk*: Data loss or corruption during enhancement
- *Mitigation*: Comprehensive backup strategy, incremental migration

#### Medium Risk
🟡 **Performance with Large Data Sets**
- *Risk*: System slowdown with hundreds of submissions
- *Mitigation*: Early performance testing, database optimization

🟡 **User Adoption Resistance**
- *Risk*: Users preferring old system or manual processes
- *Mitigation*: User training program, gradual rollout strategy

#### Low Risk
🟢 **Browser Compatibility Issues**
- *Risk*: Features not working in older browsers
- *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement, fallback features

### Testing Strategy

#### Automated Testing (Weeks 1-16)
- **Unit Tests**: 80% code coverage for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with automated scripts
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing with simulated user traffic

#### User Acceptance Testing (Weeks 11-16)
- **Alpha Testing** (Week 11): Internal team testing
- **Beta Testing** (Weeks 12-14): Limited user group (10-15 users)
- **Production Testing** (Weeks 15-16): Soft launch with monitoring

#### Security Testing (Weeks 15-16)
- **Penetration Testing**: Third-party security assessment
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated security scanning
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code review

### Deployment Strategy

#### Pre-Production (Week 15)
- **Staging Deployment**: Full system testing in production-like environment
- **Data Migration Testing**: Verify all existing data transfers correctly
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance metrics

#### Production Rollout (Week 16)
- **Soft Launch**: Limited user access (25% of users)
- **Monitoring Phase**: 48-hour intensive monitoring
- **Full Launch**: Complete system activation
- **Post-Launch Support**: 2-week intensive support period

## Next Steps

1. **Stakeholder Approval** - Present implementation plan to university leadership
2. **Team Assembly** - Recruit and onboard development team
3. **Environment Setup** - Prepare development and staging environments
4. **Kick-off Meeting** - Initiate Sprint 1 with full team
5. **Entra ID Coordination** - Begin Microsoft Entra ID integration setup with IT department

This comprehensive implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the Research Review Portal while minimizing risks and ensuring successful delivery of all required features.## Implementation and Validation Status (Sprint 1-5)

- [x] Sprint 1: Core plugin architecture, submission endpoints, data storage, REST API. ✅ implemented and verified with test runner.
- [x] Sprint 2: Enhanced submission validation, review stages, timeline/notifications, draft workflow. ✅ implemented and verified with test runner.
- [x] Sprint 3: Reviewer dashboard analytics, user metrics, workflow status endpoints. ✅ implemented and verified with direct WP REST check.
- [x] Sprint 4: Workflow/performance analytics endpoints, report export, scheduled reports. ✅ implemented and verified with direct WP REST check and feature tests.
- [x] Sprint 5: Reviewer workload analytics, COI tracking, criteria templates, rating API/UI. ✅ implemented and verified with direct WP REST check and feature tests.

### Homepage setup

- Created page "Research Review Portal" with `[research_review_portal]` in WordPress (ID 5).
- Set front page to page ID 5 (the portal page) via WP options.
- Confirmed root `/` now returns full WordPress page with stylesheet, scripts and portal embed.

### Runtime check results

- `/wp-json/research-portal/v1/health` → 200 OK
- `/wp-json/research-portal/v1/analytics/workload` → 401 (permission guarded, route exists)
- `/wp-json/research-portal/v1/conflicts` → 200 (as admin internal), route exists
- `/wp-json/research-portal/v1/config/review-templates` → 200, returns templates
- `reviews/rate` POST endpoint exists and permission protected.

### Notes

- WP-CLI default PHP (8.0.30) lacked mysqli; this is an environment path issue and not code issue.
- Direct PHP script bootstrap uses /usr/bin/php (8.3.6 with mysqli) and verifies plugin functionality.
