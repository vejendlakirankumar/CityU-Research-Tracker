## Introduction

The **CityU Research Review Portal** is a centralised digital platform for submitting and tracking academic research through structured multi-stage peer review. It covers all major research output types at City University of Seattle:

| Submission Type | Who submits |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Doctoral Dissertation | PhD & research-doctoral candidates |
| Capstone Project | Graduate program students |
| Research Paper | Faculty & researchers |
| Journal Publication | Faculty & researchers |
| Grant Proposal | Faculty & researchers |

Every submission follows a type-specific workflow: it passes through a series of reviewer stages sequentially. Each stage must be approved before the submission advances. The portal sends email notifications when action is required.

---

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Portal

1. Open your browser and navigate to your institution's portal URL (e.g. `http://deployvm.cityu.edu`).
2. You will see the public homepage. Click **Login Now** or **Login to Submit Your Work**.
3. Enter your CityU credentials (WordPress username / email + password).
4. After login you are automatically redirected to your **personal dashboard**.

### Your Dashboard

When you log in you land on the dashboard appropriate for your role:

- **Students** → Submission dashboard with "New Submission" button and list of your own submissions
- **Reviewers** → Reviewer dashboard showing your assigned reviews
- **Coordinators / Admins** → Full management dashboard with all submissions

Your name, role, and a **Logout** link are visible in the navy top bar at all times.

## Student Guide

### Submitting New Research

1. From your dashboard click **+ New Submission** (top of page).
2. Choose a **Submission Type** from the dropdown:
   - Doctoral Dissertation (ARS)
   - Capstone Project (CAP)

> **Draft saving:** Fill in the form and click **Save Draft** to preserve your work without submitting.

### Tracking Your Submission

Each submission card on your dashboard shows:

| Field | Meaning |

| Status badge | Current stage status — Pending / Under Review / Approved / Rejected |
| Current stage | Which review stage the work is at |
| Current reviewer | Name of the reviewer at the active stage |
| Due date | Expected completion date for the active stage |

Click **Details** on any card to open the full submission view with:
- Complete timeline of all stages
- Reviewer comments and feedback (once provided)
- Option to upload a revised document

### Responding to Reviewer Feedback

When a reviewer requests revisions:

1. Open the submission card and click **Details**.
2. Read the **Feedback** section carefully.
3. Prepare a revised document.
4. Click **Upload Revision** and attach the new file.
5. Add a **Response Note** explaining how you addressed each comment.
6. Click **Submit Revision**. The reviewer is notified automatically.

### Viewing the Timeline

### Date Range Filter

Use the **Today / This Week / This Month / This Year / All Time** pill bar at the top of your submission list to filter by date range. Submissions approaching their due date appear first; fully approved submissions appear last.

## Reviewer Guide

### Reviewing an Assignment

1. Click **Review** on any pending submission card.
2. The submission detail view opens showing:
   - Submitter information, title, abstract
   - Uploaded documents with an in-browser preview (PDF / Word)
   - Previous stage decisions (if any)
   - A structured **review form**
3. Read the submitted document using the built-in viewer (**Preview** button).
4. Complete the review form:
   - **Decision** — choose Approve, Request Revisions, or Reject
   - **Comments** — written feedback for the submitter (required for all decisions)
   - **Reviewer Attachment** — optionally upload a marked-up copy or supplementary file
5. Click **Submit Decision**. Your decision is recorded, the submitter is notified, and if approved, the submission automatically advances to the next stage.

> **Note:** You can save a draft of your review and return to it before clicking Submit.

### Conflict of Interest

If you have a conflict of interest with a submission, click **Declare Conflict** on the assignment card. The coordinator will be notified and will reassign the submission.

### Reviewer Rating

After a submission is fully resolved you may be asked to rate the quality of other stages' reviewers. Use the star-rating control on completed submissions to provide feedback to coordinators.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I submitted my research but cannot see it in my dashboard.**  
A: Log out and log back in. If the submission still does not appear, contact your coordinator — the submission may be pending activation of your student account.

**Q: My uploaded file is too large.**  
A: The maximum file size is 64 MB. Compress images, remove draft comments from Word files, or use PDF compression tools to reduce file size before uploading.

**Q: I received an email asking me to review a submission, but I can't see it in the portal.**  
A: Ensure you are logged in with the same email address that received the notification. If the problem persists, contact the coordinator who may need to re-assign.

**Q: I need to revise my submission but the "Upload Revision" button is greyed out.**  
A: Revisions can only be uploaded when the submission is in a "Revisions Requested" status. If your submission is still under initial review, wait for the reviewer's response.

**Q: I made a mistake in my submission details — can I edit them?**  
A: Once submitted, core metadata (title, abstract) cannot be edited by students. Contact your coordinator to make corrections.

**Q: The portal is not loading / shows a blank screen.**  
A: Try a hard reload (`Ctrl + Shift + R`). Make sure you access the portal with the exact URL given by your institution — do not type `localhost` directly. If problems persist, contact your system administrator.

**Q: How do I know when my submission has been approved?**  
A: You will receive an automatic email notification when the final stage is approved. The submission status badge on your dashboard will also change to **Approved** (green).

**Q: Can I submit multiple research items at the same time?**  
A: Yes. There is no limit on the number of active submissions per user.
