## 🔧 Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced User Management System
- **4 Custom WordPress Roles**: 
  - `research_student` - Submit and track submissions
  - `research_reviewer` - Review assigned documents  
  - `research_coordinator` - Manage department workflows
  - `research_admin` - Full system administration

- **Extended User Profiles**:
  - Department affiliation
  - Research areas/expertise
  - Student ID (for students)
  - Advisor information
  - Maximum review capacity (for reviewers)

- **Bulk Operations**:
  - User import functionality
  - Reviewer assignment management
  - Role-based permission system

### 2. Anonymous Process Documentation
- **Public Access**: No login required to view processes
- **4 Submission Types Documented**:
  - Conference Paper submissions (6 stages)
  - Publication submissions (7 stages)  
  - Student Project submissions (6 stages)
  - Grant Proposal submissions (7 stages)

- **Interactive Features**:
  - Tab-based navigation between submission types
  - Timeline visualization of review stages
  - Search functionality across all processes
  - Progress simulation with animations
  - Responsive design for all devices

- **WordPress Integration**:
  - Available via `[research_process_docs]` shortcode
  - REST API endpoints for dynamic content
  - Proper asset enqueueing (CSS/JS)

### 3. REST API Security Enhancement
- **Permission Callbacks**: Replaced open endpoints with role-based access
- **Capability Checking**: Granular permissions per endpoint
- **Data Access Control**: Users only see their own data
- **Cross-Role Protection**: Prevents data leakage between user types

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Ready for Testing:
- ✅ Test plan created (`testing/sprint1-test-plan.md`)
- ✅ Test runner built (`testing/sprint1-test-runner.php`)
- ✅ Test data generator prepared
- ✅ Validation scripts ready

### Test Categories:
1. **User Management** - Role creation, profile extensions, permissions
2. **Process Documentation** - Shortcode rendering, interactive features 
3. **REST API Security** - Permission callbacks, data access controls
4. **WordPress Integration** - Plugin activation, class loading, asset enqueueing

### Testing Requirements:
- **PHP 7.4+** (WordPress requirement)
- **WordPress 5.0+** environment
- **MySQL/MariaDB** database
- **Web server** (Apache/Nginx)

## 🚀 Resume in GitHub Codespace

### 1. Environment Setup

# Verify PHP version
php --version

# Check if WordPress is available
wp --info
```

### 2. Plugin Activation
```bash
# Navigate to WordPress installation
cd /workspace/wp-content/plugins/

# Activate the plugin
wp plugin activate research-review-portal
```

### 3. Run Sprint 1 Tests
```bash
# Execute test suite
cd /path/to/CityU-Research-Tracker
php testing/sprint1-test-runner.php

# Or run specific test functions
wp eval "run_sprint1_tests();"
```
